**EC2** is an AWS service that provides scalable and flexible computing capacity in the cloud. EC2 allows you to easily create and manage virtual servers (called instances), suitable for various applications, from development and testing to production deployment. With EC2, you have full control over computing resources, offering different instance types and sizes to optimize performance and costs according to your specific needs.

By using Amazon EC2, you gain several advantages over traditional server management:

- You can easily increase or decrease the number of instances according to actual demand, optimizing both cost and resource use.
- AWS EC2 provides multiple pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances), allowing you to choose the best approach based on your usage patterns and budget.
- EC2 integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), enabling easy user and access management through centralized accounts and policies.
- EC2 supports multiple operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS, providing flexibility for a variety of applications.
- Integrated with Session Manager (part of AWS Systems Manager), EC2 allows you to connect and manage instances without the need to open port 22 for SSH, enhancing security.
- EC2 integrates with various AWS services, including Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and CloudWatch, to facilitate seamless deployment and monitoring of applications.
- EC2 enables logging of connection sessions and commands executed via CloudTrail and Session Manager, meeting requirements for access control and auditing.
  
With these benefits, Amazon EC2 is a reliable solution that serves as an alternative to traditional physical servers, saving time and costs for deploying and managing compute resources for your applications.
